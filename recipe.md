Step 1
Heat oven to 450° F. In a small saucepan, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes and their juices, the oregano, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil.

Step 2
Reduce heat and simmer, crushing the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens, 10 to 15 minutes.

Step 3
Shape the dough into one 12- to 14-inch round and place on a baking sheet. Cover with the sauce and top with the cheese.

Step 4
Bake until the crust is golden brown and crisp, about 20 minutes.

Step 5
Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with the basil. Slice and divide among individual plates.
